# Advanced Auction Frontend

This directory contains a nextJS frontend for final contract from the auctional tutorial. This frontend now has bids being placed in FTs and displays the NFT that is being auctioned.

To get historical bids an indexing API is used. The API requires a key (which is free) to use, read [this section](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/auction/indexing-historical-data#near-blocks-api-key) to see how to get and use your own key.

## Running the frontend

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```
