This repository contains examples that are used as part of the [Auction Tutorial](https://docs.near.org/vi/tutorials/auction/basic-auction) in the documentation.

The repo contains three versions of an auction contract written in both Rust and JavaScript. The first contract is a simple auction where you can place bids and claim the auction, the second introduces NFTs as a prize and the final contract uses fungible tokens to place bids.
- [JavaScript Contracts](./contract-ts)
- [Rust Contracts](./contract-rs)

This repo also has two different frontends, one for the simple auction and one for the final contract that uses FTs and NFTs.
- [Frontends](./frontends/)

Lastly, this repo contains a factory contract written in rust that is used to deploy new auctions and initialize them.
- [Factory Contract](./factory)
